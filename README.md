# **Product-Sales-Prediction**

Predicted the total number of people who buy the product after seeing the ad. 


# **1. Introduction**

The purpose of marketing is to drive sales and although the goal of each ad campaign will vary, the goal of businesses and companies is to sell more to more people, more often and at higher prices. 

**Problem:**  Some small and large businesses lose a lot of money on bad marketing campaigns because they are not targeting potential customers.

As a small business, we cannot afford to lose money on bad marketing campaigns; we need to get our marketing message directly to prospective consumers, not to everyone.

**Solution:** predicting the number of sales can save businesses a lot of money by not targeting people who might have a low probability of buying a product or service. Forecasting sales will allow them to focus on those who have the highest likelihood of buying a product or service.

In a performance-based model, advertisers pay for consumers activities that drive a campaign goal (**sales**). That’s why predicting the number of sales is an important information for companies and advertisers. Because knowing the number of sales in advance can help businesses and other entities figure out if their advertising strategy is worth it or not. After all, we want to make money, not lose it. 

Therefore, this analysis will predict the total number of people who buy the product after seeing the ad (Approved Conversion).


# **2. Data**

The original dataset is called *KAG_conversion_data* and was downloaded from Kaggle website: [Sales Conversion Optimization](https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/clicks-conversion-tracking)
The data is about an organization's social media ad campaign. It contains 1143 observations and 11 variables. 

Approved Conversion, which represents the total number of people who bought the product after seeing the ad, will be the target variable. Because it's a continuos variable, we are dealing with a regression task.


# **3. Methodology**

**Data Cleaning:** In this step, I will eliminate any problems from the dataset which would prevent further analysis.

**Data Exploration:** In this step, I will apply statistics and visualization techniques to gain a better understanding of the dataset.

**Feature engineering:** In this final step of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I will select the most useful features or create new features from the existing ones.

**Modelling:** Apply several models to predict the number of sales and select the best performing model.

# **5. Discussion & Recommendations**

To reach an audience and make sales, advertisers need a solid marketing strategy because good marketing it’s not successful marketing until the customer has bought a product or service.

From this supervised learning experiment, interested parties will be able to determine whether they should renew the campaign or try another method of outreach. If businesses are not pleased with the number of predicted sales, then they can improve their marketing strategy to attract potential customers in their products and/or services and persuading them to choose them over those of their competitors.

As further analysis, it is recommended to measure and track the price of the product or service. When establishing a price, companies must also consider their marketing costs. However, predicting sales will allow companies determine an adequate price point to sell their products for.

In conclusion, companies or advertisers are expected to increase their customer acquisition volume and number of sales by making the appropriate improvements to their marketing plan.
