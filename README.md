# **1. Introduction**

The purpose of marketing is to drive sales and although the goal of each ad campaign will vary, the goal of businesses and companies is to sell more to more people, more often and at higher prices. 

**Problem:**  Some small and large businesses lose a lot of money on bad marketing campaigns because they are not targeting potential customers.

As a small business, we cannot afford to lose money on bad marketing campaigns; we need to get our marketing message directly to prospective consumers, not to everyone.

**Solution:** predicting the number of sales can save businesses a lot of money by not targeting people who might have a low probability of buying a product or service. Forecasting sales will allow them to focus on those who have the highest likelihood of buying a product or service.

In a performance-based model, advertisers pay for consumers activities that drive a campaign goal (**sales**). Thatâ€™s why predicting the number of sales is an important information for companies and advertisers. Because knowing the number of sales in advance can help businesses and other entities figure out if their advertising strategy is worth it or not. After all, we want to make money, not lose it. 

Therefore, this analysis will predict the total number of people who buy the product after seeing the ad (Approved Conversion).
